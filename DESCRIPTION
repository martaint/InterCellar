Description: InterCellar is implemented as an R/Bioconductor Package
  containing a Shiny app that allows users to interactively analyze cell-cell 
  communication from scRNA-seq data. Starting from precomputed ligand-receptor
  interactions, InterCellar provides filtering options, annotations and multiple visualizations
  to explore clusters, genes and functions. Finally, based on functional annotation from Gene 
  Ontology and pathway databases, InterCellar implements data-driven analyses to investigate
  cell-cell communication in one or multiple conditions.
